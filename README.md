## üîë Key Decisions Summary

Based on analysis in **SABADO_IMPLEMENTATION.md** Section 2:

### Hardware Decision

| Aspect | iPhone NFC | USB Reader (ACR122U) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Provisioning** | ‚ùå Difficult | ‚úÖ **Recommended** |
| **Daily Transactions** | ‚úÖ Possible | ‚úÖ Reliable |
| **Development** | ‚ùå Limited | ‚úÖ **Essential** |
| **Cost** | $0 (have iPhone) | ~$40 |
| **Complexity** | High (CoreNFC) | Low (nfc-pcsc) |

**Recommendation**: Start with USB reader for development and provisioning. Add iPhone support later for end-user transactions.

### Architecture Decision

```
2 Applications (Not 3):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App 1: Sabado Payment
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Owner: Sabado
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage: 3KB
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Keys: 5 AES-128 keys (K0-K4)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Offline payment amount storage
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App 2: Third-Party
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Owner: Third-Party
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage: 1KB (as requested)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Keys: 5 independent AES-128 keys
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Third-party data (Sabado cannot access)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

1. **Key Storage**: All keys in documentation are examples. Generate unique keys for production.
2. **Key Files**: Never commit `keys/*.json` to version control. Add to `.gitignore`.
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt all keys at rest using a master encryption key.
4. **Access Control**: Implement strict RBAC for key access.
5. **Audit Logging**: Log all card operations and key access.
6. **Third-Party Trust**: After App 2 key takeover, Sabado has NO ACCESS to App 2 data.
