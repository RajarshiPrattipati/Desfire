## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Component Overview

#### 2.1.1 DB Vault (Secure Key Store)
- **Purpose**: Centralized secure storage for all cryptographic keys
- **Technology**: Node.js with encrypted database (e.g., PostgreSQL with pgcrypto or HashiCorp Vault)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store PICC master keys
  - Store application-specific keys (A1, A2, A3)
  - Provide key material to authorized servers
  - Track key versions and keysets
  - Support key rotation workflows

#### 2.1.2 MIFARE DESFire Card (Secure Element)
- **Supported Models**: DESFire EV2/EV3
- **Configuration**:
  - 1 PICC master key (card-level)
  - 3 applications: Payment (A1), Transit (A2), Access Control (A3)
  - 4-6 keys per application (K0-K5)
  - Multiple keyset support for rotation

#### 2.1.3 Server Infrastructure

**Payment Server (Manages A1)**
- Process payment transactions
- Authenticate using Application 1 keys
- Read/Write payment data files
- Value file operations for balance management

**Transit Server (Manages A2)**
- Handle transit entry/exit operations
- Authenticate using Application 2 keys
- Record trip history
- Manage transit credits/passes

**Access Server (Manages A3)**
- Control physical/logical access
- Authenticate using Application 3 keys
- Log access events
- Manage access permissions

### 2.2 Application Isolation Layer
- Each application has independent key material
- File access rights mapped to application-specific key numbers
- Security breach in one app does not compromise others
- PICC master key separate from application keys

- **K3**: ChangeConfig Key - modify file access rights
- **K4-K5**: Reserved for operational keys (audit, export, future use)

#### 3.1.3 Key Material Requirements
- **Total Keys**: 1 PICC + (5 keys Ã— 3 apps) = 16 unique keys minimum
- **Key Type**: AES-128 for EV2/EV3
- **Key Uniqueness**: All keys must be cryptographically unique
- **Key Storage**: Encrypted at rest in DB Vault

### 3.2 File Structure per Application
